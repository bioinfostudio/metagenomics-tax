        # Metagenomics Taxonomic

        In this tutorial we will look at the open source software package QIIME (pronounced ’chime’). QIIME stands for Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology. The package contains many tools that enable users to analyse and compare microbial communities. 
        After completion of this tutorial, you should be able to perform a taxonomic analysis on a Illumina pair end 16S rRNA amplicon dataset.
